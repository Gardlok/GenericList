This is a practice project aimed at implementing and understanding generic data structures in C#. It project specifically focuses on a generic linked list and its associated operations.

It also includes conditional accessing (based on the state of the list) to Delegators that process the elements in the list, done so in a Strategy pattern, 

This project is for practice and learning purposes. It serves as a hands-on approach to understanding generic data structures and their operations in C#.
